 HTTP status codes for GET and POST requests
----------------------------------------------

About
=============
Status is a command line application that returns the HTTP response status code for a GET or POST request to a user submitted URL.  It has been tested in cPython 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and pypy 2.2.1 (Python v2.7.3)

Install
=============
You can install status from PyPI with pip using the following command::

    pip install status

or download the source repository and run the following command in the top level source directory::

    python setup.py install


Usage
=============
status will report the returned status code with a GET or POST request.  The general syntax is::

    status [option] <url>

It is not necessary to include the protocol (http://) in your URL. If you enter a URL without the protocol, status will prefix it with http://.  If you intend to test with the secure HTTP protocol (https://), then make this explicit in your URL.


GET Request Status Codes
------------------------------
GET is the default request type. Enter the URL as an argument to status without an option::

    status <url>



POST Request Status Codes
------------------------------
To use a POST request, add the ``-p`` or ``--post`` option::

    status -p <url>
